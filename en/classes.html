							<h2>Cooking classes</h2>
							<p>I always envisioned cooking as a sharing…</p>
							<p>What I have learnt during my journeys, my discoveries, my encounters, I share with you at home.</p>
							<p>We choose together a dish, a menu, flavours, we agree on a date and we share a pleasant class with friends or family (up to 6 guests). We enjoy at the end of the class the result of our cooking to further exchange on our experience.</p>
