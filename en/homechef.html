							<h2>Home Chef</h2>
							<p>At your convenience for your breakfasts, brunches, lunches, dinners, receptions or prolonged stays, I cook at the venue of your choice tasty dishes. I liven up your meal either in the form of a buffet or in a more traditional setting.</p>
							<p>I plan my cooking based on your request and design a culinary journey based on your expectations. I bring my blend of flavours, my gustatory surprises, my local producers and suppliers to guarantee fresh and quality ingredients.</p>
							<p>I can serve the meal (up to 6 guests) to make this meal a moment of sharing or hire a maître d’hôtel at your convenience. From the choice of the menu to the complete cleaning of your kitchen, all my services are turnkey.</p>
